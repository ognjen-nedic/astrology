This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with purpose of practice.

## Desciption

Using external API [Azstro API](aztro.sameerkumar.website) I created using my own style unique representation of data pulled from API.

The main focus of my attention was sign picker, which is similar to a clock.

## To do

- Pick and set favicon
- Finish OpenGraph (OG)
- Ability to see prediction for yesterday and tomorrow.
- Filling left side of the site with information about sign, date, current astrology planet movements etc.
- Rotation of selected sign to the top.
